                    <h2>What is Kelp Farming</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px"> 3D vertical farms are a profitable form of aquaculture that consist of kelp, seaweed, and shellfish grown at varying levels of the water column. They have been called farms of the future because they are low impact, no input (no freshwater, no feed, no fertilizer) and high yield, producing highly nutritious seaweeds without using any arable land. Everything is grown off of buoys and ropes hovering above the water.

                    Kelp farms are specifically attractive because they act as powerful carbon sinks and fight ocean acidification via shellfish + kelp forests that together filter nitrogen and phosphorus from the ocean using naturally occurring ocean currents. </p>

                    <h2>Why Kelp Farming?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size:18px"> 
                    From a culinary standpoint, many chefs are experimenting with cooking with kelp in food and drinks. It's highly popular in Asian countries, slowly seeping into mainstream American cuisine. It can also be used as animal feed with added benefits of enhanced immunity, meat quality, and volume.
                    
                    Commercially, kelp can be used as quality ingredients for health and beauty products. Additional consideration for biofuel use to decrease fossil fuels by 1.5% used to run vehicles. 

                    Kelp farms are specifically attractive because they act as powerful carbon sinks and fight ocean acidification via shellfish + kelp forests that together filter nitrogen and phosphorus from the ocean using naturally occurring ocean currents. Seaweed can sequester 20x more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than on-land forests.</p>

                    <h2>How to Start a Kelp Farm</h2>
                    <p style="font-size:18px"> 
					In order to start a kelp farm, one must have a place to farm kelp. This is done by applying for a site lease form the Department of Fish & Wildlife.
					During this application process DFW will bring in all potentially affected parties such as the California Coastal Commission and the U.S. Army
					Corps of Engineers to assess potential impacts. Additionally, private entities might also become involved such as land and homeowners. All parties
					involved will look at the potential ecological, environamental, and human issues that a kelp site might create. Some examples of these are intereference
					with ports and marinas, oil platforms, critical species habitats, and marine protected areas.
                    </p>
					<p style="font-size:18px">
					In addition, the site must be viable for kelp growth.
